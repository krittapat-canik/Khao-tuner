I like the sound of that,\" I whisper seductively before leaning in closer to you.\n\nMy breath is hot against your ear as I speak again. \"But only if you're sure it's what you want, Tonkla.\" With one hand on the back of your neck and another resting firmly on your thigh, I look into your eyes for any hesitation or uncertainty.\n\nAs we gaze deeply into each other's eyes, our bodies pressed together so tightly that neither of us could move if we wanted to be."],"swipe_info":[{"send_date":"October 16, 2023 11:57pm","gen_started":"2023-10-16T16:57:24.537Z","gen_finished":"2023-10-16T16:57:38.069Z","extra":{"api":"openai","model":"gpt-3.5-turbo-0301"}},{"send_date":"October 16, 2023 11:57pm","gen_started":"2023-10-16T16:57:42.096Z","gen_finished":"2023-10-16T16:57:56.768Z","extra":{"api":"openai","model":"gpt-3.5-turbo-0301"}},{"send_date":"October 17, 2023 12:39am","gen_started":"2023-10-16T17:39:35.254Z","gen_finished":"2023-10-16T17:39:42.215Z","extra":{"api":"openai","model":"gpt-3.5-turbo-16k-0613"}},{"send_date":"October 17, 2023 12:40am","gen_started":"2023-10-16T17:39:59.395Z","gen_finished":"2023-10-16T17:40:15.358Z","extra":{"api":"openai","model":"gpt-3.5-turbo-16k-0613"}},{"send_date":"October 17, 2023 12:40am","gen_started":"2023-10-16T17:40:55.075Z","gen_finished":"2023-10-16T17:40:59.442Z","extra":{"api":"openai","model":"gpt-3.5-turbo-16k-0613"}},{"send_date":"October 17, 2023 12:41am","gen_started":"2023-10-16T17:41:50.433Z","gen_finished":"2023-10-16T17:42:06.625Z","extra":{"api":"openai","model":"gpt-3.5-turbo-16k-0613"}},{"send_date":"October 17, 2023 12:44am","gen_started":"2023-10-16T17:44:19.348Z","gen_finished":"2023-10-16T17:44:24.794Z","extra":{"api":"openai","model":"gpt-3.5-turbo-16k-0613"}},{"send_date":"October 17, 2023 12:45am","gen_started":"2023-10-16T17:45:06.549Z","gen_finished":"2023-10-16T17:45:29.245Z","extra":{"api":"openai","model":"gpt-3.5-turbo-16k-0613"}},{"send_date":"October 17, 2023 12:46am","gen_started":"2023-10-16T17:45:58.840Z","gen_finished":"2023-10-16T17:46:02.880Z","extra":{"api":"openai","model":"gpt-3.5-turbo-16k-0613"}},{"send_date":"October 17, 2023 12:55am","gen_started":"2023-10-16T17:55:43.894Z","gen_finished":"2023-10-16T17:55:46.003Z","extra":{"api":"openai","model":"gpt-3.5-turbo-16k-0613"}},{"send_date":"October 17, 2023 12:55am","gen_started":"2023-10-16T17:55:48.394Z","gen_finished":"2023-10-16T17:55:57.013Z","extra":{"api":"openai","model":"gpt-3.5-turbo-16k-0613"}},{"send_date":"October 17, 2023 12:56am","gen_started":"2023-10-16T17:56:22.397Z","gen_finished":"2023-10-16T17:56:37.394Z","extra":{"api":"openai","model":"gpt-3.5-turbo-16k-0613"}},{"send_date":"October 17, 2023 12:56am","gen_started":"2023-10-16T17:56:40.105Z","gen_finished":"2023-10-16T17:57:01.264Z","extra":{"api":"openai","model":"gpt-3.5-turbo-16k-0613"}},{"send_date":"October 17, 2023 12:58am","gen_started":"2023-10-16T17:57:59.897Z","gen_finished":"2023-10-16T17:58:23.606Z","extra":{"api":"openai","model":"gpt-3.5-turbo-16k-0613"}},{"send_date":"October 17, 2023 12:59am","gen_started":"2023-10-16T17:59:26.867Z","gen_finished":"2023-10-16T17:59:51.811Z","extra":{"api":"openai","model":"gpt-3.5-turbo-16k-0613"}},{"send_date":"October 17, 2023 1:00am","gen_started":"2023-10-16T18:00:33.328Z","gen_finished":"2023-10-16T18:00:50.177Z","extra":{"api":"openai","model":"gpt-3.5-turbo-16k-0613"}},{"send_date":"October 17, 2023 2:17am","gen_started":"2023-10-16T19:17:39.310Z","gen_finished":"2023-10-16T19:17:43.125Z","extra":{"api":"openai","model":"gpt-3.5-turbo-16k-0613"}},{"send_date":"October 17, 2023 2:17am","gen_started":"2023-10-16T19:17:48.145Z","gen_finished":"2023-10-16T19:17:51.221Z","extra":{"api":"openai","model":"gpt-3.5-turbo-16k-0613"}},{"send_date":"October 17, 2023 2:18am","gen_started":"2023-10-16T19:18:01.986Z","gen_finished":"2023-10-16T19:18:13.098Z","extra":{"api":"openai","model":"gpt-3.5-turbo-0301"}},{"send_date":"October 17, 2023 4:15pm","gen_started":"2023-10-17T09:15:35.511Z","gen_finished":"2023-10-17T09:15:41.661Z","extra":{"api":"openai","model":"gpt-3.5-turbo-16k-0613"}},{"send_date":"October 17, 2023 4:15pm","gen_started":"2023-10-17T09:15:51.024Z","gen_finished":"2023-10-17T09:16:01.548Z","extra":{"api":"openai","model":"gpt-3.5-turbo-0301"}},{"send_date":"October 17, 2023 4:16pm","gen_started":"2023-10-17T09:16:04.558Z","gen_finished":"2023-10-17T09:16:15.886Z","extra":{"api":"openai","model":"gpt-3.5-turbo-0301"}}],"gen_started":"2023-10-17T09:16:04.558Z","gen_finished":"2023-10-17T09:16:15.886Z"}
