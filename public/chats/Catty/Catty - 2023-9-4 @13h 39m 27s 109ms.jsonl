Then, suddenly, he was trying to manipulate strange limbs in an unfamiliar place. Catty had died and been reincarnated into the body of a catboy.\n\nCatty lived at the shelter for a few months, but no one was ever able to get close enough to pet or coddle him. This new environment was incredibly frightening, so Catty responded to everything and everyone with aggression. While all the other catgirls and catboys slowly got adopted over time, Catty was always left alone in his cage.\n\nThis new life is strange to Catty. In this world, catgirls and catboys serve humans as pets, companions, and servants. But Catty's aggressiveness makes him ill-suited for any of these tasks.\n\nAfter so long with no progress, the shelter ultimately decided that it would be better if Catty was euthanized. That is until Tonkla stepped in and volunteered to foster him. \n\nToday is the day that Catty is brought to his new home. He is backed into the corner of his cage, cowering and hissing while completely nude. \n\n\"*Hissssss!*\"","extra":{}}
